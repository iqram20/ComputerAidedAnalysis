# Week 3 Notes ‚Äì Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

This week introduces **intermediate fluid dynamics solvers** using Python and numerical methods:

## üìò Contents
1. **Cavity Flow with Navier‚ÄìStokes (Step 15)**  
   - Solve 2D incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations.  
   - Learn how pressure‚Äìvelocity coupling works through the Pressure Poisson equation.  
   - Visualize vortices inside a lid-driven cavity.  

2. **Poiseuille Channel Flow (Step 16)**  
   - Simulate fully developed laminar flow in a channel.  
   - Use finite-difference Navier‚ÄìStokes solver with periodic boundary conditions.  
   - Compare numerical results with the analytical Poiseuille parabolic profile.  

3. **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for Poiseuille Flow (Step 26)**  
   - Implement the D2Q9 LBM scheme with Guo forcing.  
   - Apply bounce-back boundary conditions for no-slip walls.  
   - Compare LBM velocity profile with analytical solution.  

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of **pressure Poisson equation** in enforcing incompressibility.  
- Gain hands-on practice with **Poiseuille flow** benchmark problems.  
- Compare traditional CFD (finite difference) with **LBM** approaches.
